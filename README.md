## Job Search App

This project is part of the Ironhack FullStack Web Development Bootcamp. For our second independent project, we were given the task of creating 2 CRUDs (Create, Read, Update and Delete) to consume and input data using REST APIs.

In "Job Search App," you can create and edit users, create job postings, and users can apply for the job postings.

The Frontend was developed with React js, and the Backend functionality was coded using REST API with routes and DB from our Ironhack Bootcamp Heroku server.


### Code elements

- Light / Dark Mode using useContext Hook from React
- Axios Library and useEffect from React
- Form (with useState from React)
